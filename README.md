# Unit Testing for Data Engineering using Pytest

This repository contains unit tests for data engineering projects using pytest. Unit tests are essential for ensuring the correctness and reliability of your data pipelines, transformations, and other data engineering processes.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the environment and run the tests locally.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. This setup assumes Python 3.x.

### Installing Dependencies

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kishan9999/data-engineering-unit-test.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Ensure `requirements.txt` includes `pytest`:

   ```plaintext
   pytest
   ```

### Running the Tests

To run the unit tests, use the following command:

```bash
pytest
```

Pytest will automatically discover files named `test_*.py` or `*_test.py` in the current directory and its subdirectories and execute the test cases.

### Writing Tests

Place your test files in a directory structure that mirrors your project's structure. For example:

```
project-root/
│
├── src/
│   ├── data_processing/
│   │   ├── module1.py
│   │   ├── module2.py
│   │   └── ...
│   │
│   └── tests/
│       ├── test_module1.py
│       ├── test_module2.py
│       └── ...
│
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md
```

In this structure:

- `src/`: Contains your data engineering modules.
- `src/data_processing/`: Example directory for data processing modules.
- `src/tests/`: Directory for your unit tests.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists Python packages required for testing (`pytest` in this case).

Ensure your test functions are named with the `test_` prefix, e.g.,

```python
# test_module1.py

import pytest
from data_processing.module1 import my_function

def test_my_function():
    assert my_function(2) == 4
```

### Continuous Integration

Integrate your tests with continuous integration (CI) tools like GitHub Actions or Travis CI to automatically run tests on every push or pull request.
